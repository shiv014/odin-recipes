        This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce.

    <ol class="list">
        <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes</li>
        <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.</li>
        <p><strong><em>Note: Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.</em></strong></p>
        <li>After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.</li>
