# odin-recipes
This is simple demonstration of HTML. This is project shows Recipes of Indian dishes. The Recipes include the basic ingredients used and the steps to make those dishes.

I have used basic HTML tags as far i learnt in odin. Have added images both Relatively and  Absolute links. I have even added ALT txt for some images.

Have used <EM> and <STRONG> to give emphasis to important points.
